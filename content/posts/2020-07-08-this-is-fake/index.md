## I asked him how, to which he said: 

```
It has Wufoo branding. Hogwarts doesn't use Wufoo.
```

## Well, good. He had more to ask:

```
How many children have you fooled with this trick?
```

## But I'm not fooling children! I told him that. 

```
Ah, see I didn't make this to fool people!

It's just a fun project I made back in the day that I forgot about but it
still gets around 100 emails a month haha.

Anyway I hope you're enjoying the books and keeping safe!

## We got talking.

```
Are you Indian? What is your age?
```

I obliged, 

```
Yes I'm from India.

I'm 19 now, however this website was made when I was 12. I enjoy making
fansites.

## But he was talking between class: 

```

```

## No. 

```
Please go study. Take care.
