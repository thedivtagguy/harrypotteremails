## But he didn't stop: 

```
Please sir. 

Send sir.
```

## So I became mean: 

```
We will be sending our Pick-up Cow. Please await further instructions.
```

## To which he said: 

```
Okay thnk you.

Tell me time and when.
```

## But: 
```
We won't be able to pick you up :/ Our pick-up cow just applied for maternity leave and we only have one.
```
## But he doesn't relent: 

```
But I have no thing to travel to Hogwarts please ask headmaster or any
other thing to pick me to Hogwarts.
```

There are 10 more emails. I don't have the energy.
